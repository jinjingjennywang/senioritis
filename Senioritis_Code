We are always looking for new child scientists to join our community! To thank you for your participation, we'll be emailing you a $5 Amazon gift card - this should arrive in your inbox within the next week after we confirm your consent video and check that your child is in the age range for this study. (If you don't hear from us by then, feel free to reach out!) If you participate again with another child in the age range, you'll receive one gift card per child.",

Your child will first identify the colors of Winnie the Pooh and Piglet. Then, they will recieve instructions on the probability of getting a star based on whether the wheel lands on Yellow or Gray in a pre-practice trial. Once completed and they agree to practice, they will recieve instructions on the probability of winning a star based on the amount of Yellow or Gray on the fortune wheel in the practice trial. Then, they will choose to count or skip two sets of dots. Whenever your child finds the right answer, they will spin the fortune wheel with a chance of winning a lucky star. For the real game, there will be four different sets of dots for each of the four fortune wheels. Before beginning each different trial, an image of Mickey Mouse will appear which gives the child the opportunity to take a break if needed, or continue to the next trial. The entire study should take approximately 30 minutes. There are no anticipated risks associated with participating.",
