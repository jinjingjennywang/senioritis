Things to do in the meantime:


* Add to CoCo Dev Lab
* Familiarize with JSON
* Create GitHub account


Next steps on Lookit:


1. Set a timer to proceed automatically after 5 seconds for spinning wheels (since we cannot press “spacebar” physically to stop them) 
2. Use this template when implementing audio “https://raw.githubusercontent/Ar1780/lookit-stimuli-template/tree/master/mp3/[NAME OF FILE].mp3”
3. Implement different frames for each different page (unless documentation on Lookit says otherwise; so far I think this is what needs to be done)
4. Implement conditional logic from the beginning (practice trials)
   1. https://lookit.readthedocs.io/en/develop/researchers-condition-assignment.html#conditional-logic
5. Try to set Pooh, Piglet, and dots on the same page for pre-practice trials (if does not work, new images need to be created where Pooh, Piglet, and dots are on the same image)
6. Change .wav file to .mp3 file for Bunny “Let’s play a game” (was not able to download from GitHub server)
