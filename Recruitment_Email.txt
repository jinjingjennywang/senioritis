Subject: Online research opportunity for your child scientist!
 
Dear [parent name],
 
My name is [researcher name], a researcher at the Computational Cognitive Development group at Rutgers University - Newark. You indicated interest in learning more about online research studies like ours. We are reaching out to you because it appears that your child is in the right age range to be eligible for one of our studies. 
 
In our study, we are investigating how 4- to 6-year-old children react to probabilities. Your child will play a counting game to help some friends figure out who has more. Whenever your child finds the right answer, they will spin a wheel with a chance of a lucky star.The study takes about 30 minutes and we offer a small $5 e-gift card compensation to thank you for participating.  
 
If you are interested in signing up to participate, please follow this link to pick a time slot that works for you: https://calendly.com/alejandrareinoso/number-game-study
 
If none of the listed time slots work for you, please email me your preferred times and we will try to make it work for you. 
 
Feel free to let me know if you have any questions or concerns. 
 
Looking forward to meeting your child scientist! 
 
Sincerely,
