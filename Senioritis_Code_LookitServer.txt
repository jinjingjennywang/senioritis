We hope that you enjoyed the study and know how thankful we are for your participation. Our goal of discovering how young children learn about the world would not be possible without volunteers like you! Please tell your friends about your experience. We are always looking for new child scientists to join our community! To thank you for your participation, we'll be emailing you a $5 Amazon gift card - this should arrive in your inbox within the next week after we confirm your consent video and check that your child is in the age range for this study. (If you don't hear from us by then, feel free to reach out!) If you participate again with another child in the age range, you'll receive one gift card per child.",

Once completed and they agree to practice, they will recieve instructions on the probability of winning a star based on the amount of Yellow or Gray on the fortune wheel in the practice trial. Then, they will choose to count or skip two sets of dots. Whenever your child finds the right answer, they will spin the fortune wheel with a chance of winning a lucky star. For the real game, there will be four different sets of dots for each of the four fortune wheels. Before beginning each different trial, an image of Mickey Mouse will appear which gives the child the opportunity to take a break if needed, or continue to the next trial. The entire study should take approximately 30 minutes. There are no anticipated risks associated with participating.",
