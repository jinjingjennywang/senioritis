Dear Amy,
 
Thank you for your interest in our research! Please find the meeting information for your appointment tomorrow below. If anything comes up and you would like to reschedule, please let us know.
 
Before the appointment, there are 4 more steps to help prepare a smooth experience for your family:
 
1. Please read and sign our parental consent form.
2. Please follow this link to help us understand the scope and limits of our research. Your answers to these questions are not linked to your child's data in any way.
3. Our study works the best on a computer (desktop or laptop), instead of a phone or tablet.
4. Please use https://www.speedtest.net/ to help find out the speed of your internet.
